Repo for project for data mining course 2015, elte

This project is about trying basic data mining methods on the [Online News Popularity dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity) while trying to predict the number of shares of an article. This is a publicly available dataset at  [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.html).

The main steps of this project are:

1. data collecting and cleaning is already done.
2. basic data transformation, e.g. of the target variable
3. data exploration
4. run different prediction models
5. measure their performance
6. present results
